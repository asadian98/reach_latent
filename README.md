# Reach Latent

This repository features a live MATLAB script designed for working with Churchland's maze dataset. You can access the dataset [here](https://github.com/dandisets/000128/).

## Overview

The script enables you to:

- Work with NWB datasets in MATLAB.
- Reconstruct the original behavioral task from the dataset.
- Perform a variety of analyses, including:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - jPCA
  - dPCA
  - Factor Analysis

Additionally, the script provides tools for identifying orthogonal subspaces related to preparation and execution.

## Prerequisites
